This is the admin dashboard for AACE (Albanian Association of Civil Engineers). The project started as a proof of concept for a social platform to group all the civil engineers of the association, and pave the way for the still in progress, governmentally defined "Order of the Engineers", which seeks to standardize and legalize all engineering efforts in the country. This proof of concept was demonstrated to various interested parties and stakeholders, in particular the Civil Engineering Association in Netherlands.
